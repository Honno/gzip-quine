# What is this?

This is a seperate repository for my article of gzip quines, which is live at [matthewbarber.io/gzip-quine/](http://matthewbarber.io/gzip-quine/).

I wanted to remove this article from my blog so I could update my blog layout easily, as when I wrote this initially I made various custom extensions to minima (default Jekyll theme)... I do not want to work that out again.

In the future, I'd like to update this repo with a new style, and remove the unnecessary Jekyll stuff. Also want to touch upon zip quines, so that I can actually say I made a tutorial on zip bombs/make the compressed-archive-quine journey more accessible for Windows users.
